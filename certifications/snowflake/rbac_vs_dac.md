| Feature                   | RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)                                                                                     | DAC (Discretionary Access Control)                                                                                              |

| **Definition**            | Access control model where permissions are assigned to roles, and users inherit permissions by being assigned roles. | Access control model where object owners (users) have full control over their objects and can grant permissions to other users. |
| **Control Level**         | Organization-wide, centralized access control through roles.                                                         | Object-level, decentralized access control through ownership.                                                                   |
| **Permission Assignment** | Permissions are granted to **roles**, and users inherit them by being assigned a role.                               | Permissions are granted directly to **users** or roles by the object owner.                                                     |
| **Object Ownership**      | Ownership is less significant; access is determined by assigned roles.                                               | The user who creates an object is its owner and controls access to it.                                                          |
| **Management Complexity** | Easier to manage in large organizations due to structured roles.                                                     | Can become complex if many users manage access individually.                                                                    |
| **Scalability**           | Highly scalable; permissions are managed via roles, making it easy to apply changes at scale.                        | Less scalable; requires individual users to manage access, which can become tedious.                                            |
| **Inheritance**           | Roles can inherit permissions from other roles (hierarchical structure).                                             | No direct inheritance mechanism; each user must be granted access manually.                                                     |
| **Use Case**              | Best suited for enterprises with structured roles and large teams.                                                   | Suitable for environments where individual users need more control over their own objects.                                      |
| **Example in Snowflake**  | `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE sales TO ROLE analyst;` then assign the role to a user: `GRANT ROLE analyst TO USER john;`    | `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE sales TO USER john;` (directly assigns permissions to a user).                                           |
