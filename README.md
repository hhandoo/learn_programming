# Learn Programming

Welcome to the **Learn Programming** repository! I made this repo to get started with programming concepts and practices. It provides simple and effective examples for beginners, focusing on C++ as a starting point.

## Introduction
This repository contains examples of basic programming techniques to help you understand how to write, compile, and execute your code. We'll focus on C++ as a starting point but aim to expand to other languages in the future. 

By following the examples, you'll learn how to:
- Write simple programs
- Compile and execute your code
- Get comfortable with the development environment

## How to Compile Code

### C++ Code Example

Hereâ€™s a basic **C++** program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Compiling the Code
To compile the C++ code, open your terminal, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and run the following command:

```bash
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
```
This will compile the hello.cpp file and produce an executable file named hello.

### Running the Compiled Program
Once the code is compiled successfully, you can run the program by using the following command in the terminal:

```bash
./hello
```
This will execute the program and you should see the output:
```
Hello, World!
```
