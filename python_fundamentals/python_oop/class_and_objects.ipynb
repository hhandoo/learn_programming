    "# Inheritance in Python - A Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It allows a class (child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or base class). This promotes **code reuse, modularity, and hierarchy-based structuring**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Why Use Inheritance?**\n",
    "- **Code Reusability:** Avoids redundant code by allowing reuse of common functionality.\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Classification:** Helps in defining relationships between different classes (e.g., Vehicle → Car, Bike).\n",
    "- **Extensibility:** New functionalities can be added without modifying the parent class.\n",
    "- **Polymorphism:** Allows overriding methods in derived classes for customized behavior.\n",

    "🔹 **MRO determines the order in which methods are inherited in Python.**  \n",
    "🔹 It follows **C3 Linearization (Depth-First + Left-to-Right)** to avoid conflicts.  \n",
    "🔹 **Use `mro()` or `__mro__`** to check the order in which methods will be resolved.  \n",
    "🔹 **In multiple inheritance, Python follows the left-to-right order in class definition.**  \n",
    "🔹 **`super()` calls the next method in the MRO, making it essential for cooperative inheritance.**\n",

    "The `super()` function allows calling a method from the parent class.\n",

    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "✅ Inheritance simplifies code structure by reusing existing functionalities.  \n",
    "✅ Python supports **single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance**.  \n",
    "✅ **Method overriding** allows customized behavior in child classes.  \n",
    "✅ **`super()`** helps access parent class methods efficiently.  \n",
    "✅ **MRO** ensures the correct method resolution order in complex inheritance scenarios."
